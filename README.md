# family_space_flutter

Here is a proof of concept project for family space.

There's a lot of crutches and hardcode things but it's ok for POC project.

there's neccessary to make some tunes for iOS build related to gmaps and mapbox.

before build or run please run `run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.
